Silent streams swirl silver shades,
A midnight sky with stars displayed,
The wind whispers secrets in the trees,
And earthy scents that rustle with ease.

The sun rises, paint the day,
With hues of gold and pink in play,
The breeze stirs life from slumber deep,
And all around, new life does creep.

In forests dark, where ancient ones sleep,
The trees their vigil keep, their secrets keep,
Their leaves a rustling, soft susurration,
As nature's rhythms are simply creation.

The moon glows bright, with silvery light,
A beacon in the dark of night,
It guides us through life's ebb and flow,
And whispers truths that only come to know.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, a world to cease,
From worries, fears, and endless strife,
We lose ourselves, and find new life.
