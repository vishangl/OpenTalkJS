Title: Investigating the Effects of Urbanization on Mental Health in Low-Income Communities: A Mixed-Methods Study

Abstract:

Urbanization has become a pervasive trend worldwide, with significant implications for mental health. In low-income communities, where access to resources and support is often limited, the impact of urbanization on mental health can be particularly pronounced. This mixed-methods study aimed to investigate the relationship between urbanization and mental health outcomes in low-income communities. A mixed-methods design was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

Results showed that residents of low-income urban areas reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression compared to their counterparts in rural or suburban areas. Qualitative interviews revealed that factors such as job insecurity, lack of community support, and exposure to crime contributed to mental health challenges. However, the study also found that some residents reported positive experiences, including access to affordable housing, cultural diversity, and community resources.

The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions addressing the specific needs of low-income urban communities. The results suggest that a holistic approach incorporating physical activity, social support, and access to mental health services is essential in mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization on mental health.

Keywords: urbanization, mental health, low-income communities, stress, anxiety, depression.
