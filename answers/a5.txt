In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
A gentle breeze stirs, rustling leaves,
As nature awakens from her sleep.

The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their branches stretching to behold
The sun's last rays, a golden glow,
That lights the world, in all its show.

The river's voice, a soothing sound,
Echoes through the landscape, all around.
It winds and turns, a winding stream,
Through hills and valleys, it gently gleams.

In this land of beauty, wild and free,
The creatures roam, in harmony.
The birds sing sweet, their melodies bright,
As flowers bloom, in colors vibrant light.

The wind whispers secrets, to the trees,
Of far-off lands, where magic frees.
And as we walk, through nature's gate,
We find our peace, in her gentle state.
